Crime Data Cleaning Project
This project involves cleaning and preprocessing a dataset of crime reports from a CSV file. The dataset contains details about various crime incidents, such as crime type, date and time of the event, neighborhood, and reporting area. The goal is to prepare the data for further analysis, such as exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
